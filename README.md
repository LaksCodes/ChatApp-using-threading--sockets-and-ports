# Chat Application

This project is a network-based chat application built in Python using the client-server architecture. It allows multiple clients to connect to a central server and communicate with each other in real-time. The application supports text-based messaging and includes features such as user authentication, message logging, and coordinator-exclusive commands.

## Features

- **Client-Server Architecture:** Utilizes a central server to facilitate communication between multiple clients.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI):** Provides a user-friendly interface for logging in and sending messages.
- **Threading:** Uses threading to handle concurrent processes, allowing the server, client, and GUI to run simultaneously.
- **User Authentication:** Clients are required to enter a unique username before connecting to the server.
- **Message Logging:** Logs all messages exchanged during the chat session, allowing users to save the conversation.
- **Coordinator-Exclusive Commands:** Includes commands that can only be executed by the coordinator, such as viewing members and saving the conversation.

## Usage
1. Run the application
2. The first user to log in becomes the server. Use the GUI to log in and send messages.
